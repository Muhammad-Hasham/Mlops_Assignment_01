Repository pattern mein hum basically abstraction kar rahe hote hain. Entities ki repositories hoti hain. When you make a repository, unit of work mein os repository ka humein access mil jata hai. Tou hota hai hai keh hume 1 generic pattern banaya wa hota hai jismein humein kuch methods define kia we hote hain. Jab bhi hum entity banate hain tab oski repository zaroor banate hain and then we inject thr repository in unit of work that means repository ka reference oske andar aa jai ga. Repository is extended aur oske andar jo methods hote hain eg CRUD ke custom methods that we need are in the repository. Tou hata yeh hai keh jab repository banate hain osko hum extend karte hain generic repository se aur generic mein humare pas T entity hoti hai that means ismein kuch bhi aa sukta hai like jo hum oske pass karein gai vo aa jata hai. Generic ke andar hum entity pass karte hain. Repository, generic repository se extend hoti hain aur generic mein hum oski entity pass kar dete hain. Custom methods are implemented in repositories (for each respective entity), all generic functions are implemented generic repository. Whenever we have to use a method beshak vo custom ho ya generic we will use that by accessing the repository. Repository is extended from generic repository then repository is injected in unit of work and not through unit of work i can access generic and custom methods from that repository. We have one controller layer, one service layer and one repository layer. Now for everything it's not necessary to go to repository layer. Basically jo humari database layer hai jismein humne koi transactions karni ho or anything vo hum sara kar rahe hote hain repository methods se aur os data ke uper jo koi bhi operations (business logic) karni hoti hai vo hum services ki layer mein karte hain. Services and IServices are separate, repository and IRepository are separate. There will be only one generic repository. One entity will have a repository and a controller and a service. Controller calls the service, service calls the repository and repository calls the db. Repository ke andar main cheez hoti hai dbcontext (which wont be found in controller or service) and dbcontext is connected with database base. So whenever we have to do a query we will do it in the repository and whenever we have to do operations on that query that will be done in the service aur controller jo hai vo service ko call kare ga. All db logic will be in the repository. All business logic will be in the service
